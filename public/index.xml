      <description>Introduction I am Tristan Phillips, a nobody who is looking to just play around on the internet.
What will I post here? My thoughts and experiences, and anything in-between.
What do I expect? This is simply a kind of public journal for me, to keep track of my life in a way that I control the information being shared. Even if it is very public and personal to me. I hope to be able to look back on this in the future and see how far I have come.</description>
